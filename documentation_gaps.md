# Plantarium Documentation Gaps & Clarifications Needed

This document outlines areas in the current Plantarium specification that would benefit from additional detail or clarification.

## Functional Concerns

### 1. Mobile Support Strategy
- While the future roadmap mentions a mobile companion app, the current specification is desktop-focused
- Consider clarifying whether Flutter's mobile capabilities will be utilized in the initial release
- Will the UI be designed with mobile responsiveness in mind from the start?
- Is there a tablet-specific interface planned?

### 2. Garden Layout Visualization Implementation
- More specific details needed on the implementation approach for the garden layout canvas
- Which Flutter packages/widgets will be used for the drag-and-drop functionality?
- How will the garden layout be rendered and scaled across different screen sizes?
- Consider detailing the approach for implementing the visual plant representation

### 3. Offline Data Synchronization
- The specification mentions offline functionality but doesn't detail how data will synchronize when connection is restored
- What conflict resolution strategies will be used if changes are made offline and online?
- Will there be a queue system for actions performed offline?
- How will the app prioritize which data to cache for offline use?

### 4. API Fallback Mechanisms
- What happens if the Permapeople API is unavailable for extended periods?
- How extensive is the local caching of plant data?
- Is there a built-in fallback dataset for essential plant information?
- How will the app communicate API unavailability to users?

### 5. Data Backup & Export
- The specification mentions backup/restore as "if feasible" but doesn't detail the implementation
- What data export formats will be supported?
- Will there be cloud backup options?
- How will users restore their data if needed?
- Will there be an automatic backup function?

## Technical Concerns

### 6. SQLite Implementation Details
- No information about database schema design
- How will migrations be handled when updating the app?
- How will complex data relationships be managed in SQLite?
- Will an ORM be used? If so, which one?

### 7. State Management Approach
- No mention of the state management approach in Flutter
- Which pattern will be used (Provider, Bloc, Riverpod, GetX, etc.)?
- How will state be shared between different parts of the application?
- How will the app handle complex state dependencies?

### 8. Testing Strategy
- The documentation lacks information on testing approaches
- What types of tests will be implemented (unit, integration, widget)?
- Will there be automation testing for the UI?
- What test coverage targets are expected?
- How will the garden layout canvas functionality be tested?

### 9. Performance Benchmarks
- No specific performance targets or benchmarks are defined
- What are the target load times for different screens?
- Are there performance expectations for the garden layout with many plants?
- How will performance be measured and monitored?
- What are the minimum hardware requirements?

### 10. Deployment and Distribution
- No details on how the app will be packaged and distributed for each platform
- Which platforms will be prioritized for initial release?
- Will the app be distributed through app stores or direct download?
- How will updates be delivered?
- What's the versioning strategy?

## Additional Considerations

### 11. Internationalization/Localization
- Not addressed if the app will support multiple languages
- Will there be support for region-specific plant data and climate information?
- How will date formats be handled for different regions?
- Will units of measurement be customizable (metric vs imperial)?

### 12. Minimum OS Requirements
- No specification of minimum OS versions supported
- What are the oldest versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux that will be supported?
- Are there specific Linux distributions that will be officially supported vs. others?

### 13. Accessibility Compliance
- While basic accessibility is mentioned, specific standards aren't referenced
- Will the app conform to WCAG guidelines? If so, which level?
- How will accessibility be tested?
- Which assistive technologies will be specifically supported?

### 14. Error Handling & Logging
- Limited details on how errors will be handled and communicated to users
- Will there be a logging system for troubleshooting?
- How will crash reports be collected?
- What's the strategy for app recovery after crashes?

## Conclusion

Addressing these areas would provide more comprehensive guidance for development and help ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project scope and implementation details.

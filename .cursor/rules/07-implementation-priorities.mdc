# Implementation Priorities & Current Status

This rule outlines the development priorities for the Plantarium project, helping guide implementation efforts.

## Development Phases Strategy
The full development strategy is outlined in [development_phases.md](mdc:development_phases.md), which breaks the project into 7 phases:
1. Foundation & Core Architecture
2. Garden Layout System
3. Plant Database & API Integration
4. Climate & Scheduling System
5. Advanced Gardening Features
6. Polishing & Optimization
7. Beta Testing & Launch

## Current Phase: 1 - Frontend Development Focus
The current development phase focuses on establishing the Flutter frontend foundation to connect with the existing NestJS backend.

## Key Implementation Areas

### Backend Integration
- API client for NestJS backend communication
- Local storage with SQLite
- State management architecture
- Data synchronization mechanisms

### UI Framework
- Design system and theming
- Navigation architecture
- Responsive layout framework
- Core UI components

### Core Functionality
- Garden layout canvas implementation
- Plant database integration
- Climate-adapted planting schedules
- Notification system

## Progress Tracking
Detailed progress tracking is maintained in [tasks/tasks.md](mdc:tasks/tasks.md) following this format:
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Completed task

Tasks marked as [x] in the tasks document are typically already implemented in the NestJS backend.

## Priority Guidelines
1. First establish the core architecture and connectivity
2. Then implement basic UI components and navigation
3. Focus on data models and repositories
4. Finally implement specific garden planning features

## Known Documentation Gaps
Areas requiring additional clarification are documented in [documentation_gaps.md](mdc:documentation_gaps.md) and should be addressed before implementing related features.

## Testing Requirements
All new implementations require corresponding tests:
- Unit tests for models and business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for API connectivity

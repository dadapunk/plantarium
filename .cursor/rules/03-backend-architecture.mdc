# Backend Architecture

The Plantarium backend is a NestJS application that serves as the API layer between the frontend and external data sources.

## Core Modules
- **Plant Module** (`backend/src/plant/`): Manages plant data, integrates with Permapeople API
- **Plot Module** (`backend/src/plot/`): Handles garden layouts, beds, and plant placement
- **API Integration** (`backend/src/api-permapeople/`): Interfaces with the Permapeople plant database API
- **Garden Notes** (`backend/src/garden-notes/`): Manages user notes and observations

## Database Integration
The backend uses SQLite for local data persistence, storing:
- User garden layouts
- Plant data cache from Permapeople API
- Planting history for crop rotation
- User calendar and task data
- Custom plants added by users

## API Endpoints
The backend provides REST API endpoints for:
- CRUD operations on garden layouts and beds
- Plant information retrieval and caching
- User tasks and calendar events
- Weather data integration from OpenWeather

## Authentication & Data Security
- Local data storage with SQLite
- Secure storage of API keys for external services
- Protection of user garden data

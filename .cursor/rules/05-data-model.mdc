# Data Models & Database Schema

Plantarium uses SQLite for local data storage. This rule outlines the key data models and relationships.

## Core Entities

### Garden Areas
- Represents distinct gardening areas (e.g., "Backyard", "Front Yard")
- Properties: id, name, description, location data

### Garden Beds
- Represents planting beds within garden areas
- Properties: id, garden_area_id, name, shape data (coordinates), dimensions, soil type
- Relationships: Belongs to a Garden Area, contains Plants

### Plants
- Plant data from Permapeople API or user-created
- Properties: id, name, family, planting instructions, growth habits, spacing requirements, days to maturity
- Additional data: companion planting data, water/sun needs
- May have a cached flag to indicate origin (API vs. custom)

### Plantings
- Represents instances of plants placed in garden beds
- Properties: id, plant_id, bed_id, position data, planting date, expected harvest date
- Stores historical data for crop rotation tracking
- Relationships: Belongs to a Plant and a Garden Bed

### Tasks
- Garden tasks and reminders
- Properties: id, type, description, due date, associated plant/bed IDs
- Types include: planting, fertilizing, harvesting, watering, custom

### User Settings
- User preferences and configuration
- Properties: location data (for weather), notification preferences, UI settings

## Database Relationships
- Garden Areas contain multiple Garden Beds
- Garden Beds contain multiple Plantings
- Plants have multiple Plantings (instances)
- Tasks can be associated with specific Plants, Plantings, or Beds

## Data Persistence Strategy
- Automatic saving of garden layouts and changes
- Caching of API data for offline use
- Backup and restore capabilities

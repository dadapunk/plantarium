## Step 2: Add Plants to Your Garden

final tomato = Plant(
  name: 'Tomato',
  variety: 'Cherry',
  spacing: Spacing(24, 36), // inches
  companionPlants: ['Basil', 'Marigold']
);

garden.addPlant(tomato, position: Point(2, 3));
```

## Step 3: Set Up Your Garden Calendar

1. Review the suggested planting schedule
2. Customize tasks and reminders

      plant: tomato,
      date: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 7)),
      reminder: true

  ]
);
```

## Step 4: Start Your Garden Journal

1. Create your first garden note
2. Add photos of your garden
3. Record observations and measurements

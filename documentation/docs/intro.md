# Tutorial Intro

Welcome to the project! This tutorial will guide you through setting up and running the application, including Swagger for API documentation and Docusaurus for static site generation.

## Installation

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

To start the local development server and open up a browser window:

```bash
npm start
```

Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Husky

Will run tests before every commits to avoid upload buggy code.

## Aditional Tools

### Swagger

Swagger is running by default for API documentation. You can access it at:

```
http://localhost:3002/api
```

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is used for generating this documentation . Here are the commands to run the Docusaurus documentation site:

### Run

```bash
cd documentation
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Deployment

# Plantarium Future Roadmap Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the future development phases of Plantarium. While the MVP focuses on core functionality, this documentation outlines the complete architectural vision and detailed specifications for the full product.

## Contents

- **[Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md)**: Detailed architectural patterns and design decisions
- **Feature Specifications**: Comprehensive specifications for all planned features (to be developed)
- **Testing Strategy**: Complete test coverage plan for all components (to be developed)
- **API Documentation**: Full API specifications including future endpoints (to be developed)
- **User Documentation**: Comprehensive end-user documentation (to be developed)
- **Development Guidelines**: Coding standards and best practices (to be developed)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous integration and deployment specifications (to be developed)

## Related Documentation

For the current implementation phase, please refer to the [MVP documentation](../mvp/README.md), particularly:

- [MVP Overview](../mvp/mvp_overview.md): Current implementation scope and goals
- [Core Features](../mvp/core_features.md): Essential features in the MVP
- [Implementation Plan](../mvp/implementation_plan.md): Current development tasks

## Purpose

This documentation serves as a north star for the project's long-term vision. It provides:
- A complete architectural blueprint
- Detailed specifications for all planned features
- Comprehensive development guidelines
- Full testing and quality assurance plans

While the MVP implementation (documented in `../mvp/`) focuses on essential functionality, this documentation preserves the robust, production-ready approach for future development phases.

## How to Use This Documentation

- Start with the [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md) for the complete technical vision
- Refer to the [MVP documentation](../mvp/README.md) to understand what's currently being implemented
- Use other documents in this directory (as they are developed) for planning future phases

See the [main documentation README](../README.md) for more information on our documentation approach.

## Implementation Timeline

The documentation in this directory is organized with version indicators to clarify when different components are planned for implementation:
- **v1.0 (MVP)**: Currently being implemented
- **v1.x**: Near-term enhancements after MVP
- **v2.0+**: Longer-term features and improvements

# Plantarium MVP Documentation

This directory contains essential documentation for the Plantarium MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The documentation here is focused on the core functionality implemented in the first phase of development.

## Contents

- **[MVP Overview](mvp_overview.md)**: Description of the MVP scope and goals
- **[Core Features](core_features.md)**: Documentation of implemented MVP features
- **[Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md)**: Simplified refactoring plan for the MVP

## Related Documentation

For the complete architectural vision and detailed specifications for future phases, please refer to the [roadmap documentation](../roadmap/README.md), particularly:

- [Architecture Overview](../roadmap/architecture_overview.md): The complete architectural vision
- Other roadmap documents that will be created as the project progresses

## Purpose

This documentation is intentionally kept minimal and focused on what's needed for the MVP phase. The MVP documentation prioritizes:
- Essential information for developers and users
- Clarity and simplicity
- Documentation of implemented features only

## How to Use This Documentation

- Start with the [MVP Overview](mvp_overview.md) to understand the goals and scope
- Review the [Core Features](core_features.md) to see what functionality is included
- Use the [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) for development tasks and tracking progress

See the [main documentation README](../README.md) for more information on our documentation approach.

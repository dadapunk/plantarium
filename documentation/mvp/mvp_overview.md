# Plantarium MVP Overview

## Purpose

The Plantarium MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is designed to validate the core functionality and value proposition of the application with minimal development effort. This approach allows us to get feedback from users quickly before investing in a more comprehensive implementation.

## MVP Scope

The MVP focuses on the following core features:

### Garden Notes
- Basic creation, viewing, editing, and deletion of garden notes
- Simple markdown formatting support
- Basic offline capability for notes
- Minimal UI with essential functionality

### Core Infrastructure
- Simple repository pattern for data access
- Basic state management with Riverpod
- Essential error handling
- Minimal API client implementation
- Simple local storage for offline functionality

### User Interface
- Functional garden notes list view
- Basic note editor with essential formatting options
- Simple loading and error states
- Focus on usability over advanced features

## Out of Scope for MVP

The following features are deliberately excluded from the MVP:

- Advanced offline synchronization
- Complex UI animations and transitions
- Comprehensive test coverage
- CI/CD pipeline
- Advanced caching strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced markdown features
- Advanced search and filtering
- Responsive layouts for multiple device sizes
- Integration with external services

## MVP Goals

1. **Validate Core Functionality**: Confirm that the garden notes feature meets basic user needs
2. **Test Technical Approach**: Validate the chosen architectural patterns and libraries
3. **Gather User Feedback**: Collect insights to guide future development priorities
4. **Establish Development Workflow**: Create a foundation for future development iterations
5. **Demonstrate Value Quickly**: Show stakeholders a working product to secure continued support

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

- Users can reliably create, edit, view, and delete garden notes
- Basic offline functionality works as expected
- The application is stable and free from critical bugs
- The UI is intuitive and usable
- We gather meaningful feedback to guide the next development phase

# Plantarium MVP Implementation Notes

## Local Storage Approach

### Decision Summary
For the Plantarium MVP, we've implemented a simplified local storage approach using SharedPreferences instead of a more complex solution with SQLite and connectivity tracking. This decision follows the YAGNI principle ("You Aren't Gonna Need It") and focuses on delivering essential functionality with minimal complexity.

### Implementation Details

1. **GardenNoteCacheService**
   - Uses SharedPreferences for lightweight data persistence
   - Provides basic caching of garden notes data
   - Simple JSON serialization/deserialization for garden notes
   - Minimal error handling and logging

2. **Garden Notes Data Management**
   - Garden notes are stored and managed entirely locally
   - No online/offline detection required for garden notes in the MVP
   - No synchronization mechanism needed at this stage
   - SharedPreferences provides sufficient functionality for MVP needs

3. **Reasons for Simplified Approach**
   - Garden notes data volume is expected to be minimal for the MVP
   - SharedPreferences provides sufficient functionality for basic caching needs
   - Simplifies the codebase and reduces potential bugs
   - Faster implementation time allows for quicker user feedback

4. **Removed Complexity**
   - Eliminated ConnectivityService dependency from garden notes feature
   - Removed complex offline mode and synchronization logic
   - Simplified error handling for storage operations
   - Removed online/offline UI indicators for garden notes feature

### Future Enhancements

While the current implementation is sufficient for the MVP, future versions may incorporate:

1. **Remote Synchronization**
   - Server-side storage for garden notes
   - Synchronization between devices
   - Proper conflict resolution for concurrent edits

2. **Enhanced Local Storage**
   - SQLite-based persistence for better data management
   - Support for larger datasets and complex queries
   - Better performance for growing datasets

3. **Connectivity Features**
   - Real connectivity monitoring with the connectivity_plus package
   - Proper online/offline state management for remote features
   - UI indicators for connectivity status

### Conclusion

The simplified local storage approach meets the current MVP needs while keeping the implementation lean and maintainable. By focusing on local storage only for garden notes, we can validate core functionality quickly before investing in more complex features that may not be necessary.
